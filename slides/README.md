# Slide Projects Workspace

Create a subdirectory for each engagement (for example <code>slides/q1-update/</code>) and store outlines, generated PPTX exports, and support assets there. Keeping projects isolated makes it easier to script operations from <code>src.cli</code> or the JavaScript renderer without overwriting other work.

<ol>
  <li>Keep raw outlines (<code>*.json</code> or <code>*.md</code>) alongside your generated decks for traceability.</li>
  <li>Export thumbnails or QA captures into a dedicated <code>media/</code> subfolder if you need snapshots.</li>
  <li>Archive completed work by moving the project folder to <code>slides/archive/&lt;year&gt;/</code>.</li>
</ol>
